These are solutions to RL and MDP assignments to the programming assignments in the course CS747: Foundations of Intelligent and Learning Agents for Autumn 2023.
# Reinforcement Learning in Billiards
Designed an agent that employed decision-time planning using Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to identify the most suitable ball to pot and to determine the force that should be applied to the ball along with optimal angle.

# MDP Planning on Half-Field Offence Football
Formulated an MDP to compute an optimal strategy for scoring goals in a Half Field Offense scenario, where two attackers (B1 and B2) face one defender (R) on a 4x4 grid football pitch with a 2-unit long goal.
